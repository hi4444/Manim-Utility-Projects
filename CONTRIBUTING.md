## üß© Project Overview

**Manim Utility Projects** provides a suite of PowerShell tools that automate rendering tasks for [Manim Community Edition](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim).  
The flagship script, `Manim_Run.ps1`, is a powerful wrapper for `manim.exe` that:

- Automatically locates and caches the `manim.exe` executable.  
- Provides an **interactive menu** for selecting render options and flags.  
- Simplifies command-line complexity for both beginners and advanced Manim users.  
- Supports both **Menu mode** (guided) and **Manual mode** (custom argument builder).

Your contributions help keep these tools current, reliable, and easy to use across different Manim setups.
