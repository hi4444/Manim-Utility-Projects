## 📚 Overview

**Manim Utility Projects** is a collection of scripts and tools designed to streamline workflows for the [Manim Community Edition (ManimCE)](https://www.manim.community/).  
Its core PowerShell script, `Manim_Run.ps1`, acts as an **interactive launcher** that automates Manim scene rendering through an easy-to-use menu system.

This guide explains:
- How to set up your environment  
- How to propose and test changes  
- How to extend the script (e.g., add new CLI flags or modes)  
- Project standards for commits, branches, and pull requests
